The Main program run is in GUI/master/main.py

Individual Modules that are used by main (like the program guide) are located in /GUI/functions/theirname

Be careful because some modules may require global paths to find files and modules.

All GUI code is written in Python.  For more information on modules we had to load to get python to do what we want (such as TKINTER) take a look at the log.tar file in the /GUI directory for detailed information on everything we did.  

Have FUN!!!
