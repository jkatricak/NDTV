Others
------------------------------------------------------------------

Versitile player (unfortunately GUI)
XMMS
htpp://www.xmms.org
Many Plugins.  Can record internet radio, manage playlists, etc.
RedHat 8.0 may have problems playing mp3's according to XMMS website.



Recorder:
VCR
http://www.stack.nl/~brama/vcr/
VCR is a program which enables you to record a program using a video grabber card that's 
supported by the video4linux drivers. It doesn't require a graphical environment, and you 
can use all popupular windows codecs (like DivX, Indeo Video 5, etc) because VCR is built 
around the avifile library. Now, you can finally record your favourite program from a remote 
place, because Murphy's law dictates that you remember to record it when you're as far away 
from your home as possible...



Converter:
av_convert 
http://merkur.2y.net/av_convert/

The main part of av_convert is a C++ API for accessing audio/video files 
(AVI, Quicktime, YUV4MPEG stream, WAV, etc.). This functionality is provided 
by a library and a set of plugin modules for I/O backends and audio/video codecs. 
Using this library, "av_convert" can convert between these file formats and provide 
basic editing functions, such as cutting parts of different video sources to one destination. 
The included program "av_rec" can record real-time video from a v4l-video-source with A/V sync.



DVD Manipulation
dvd_disc
http://linuxtv.org/dvd/

dvd_disc is a Linux kernel module that provides unified access to a DVD Video by a 
DVD Navigator. It utilises a common interface for dvd_file and dvd_udf, both of which are 
included in the package. dvd_udf accesses a DVD Video via the raw drive device and decodes 
the UDF file structure on the disc. dvd_file accesses a DVD Video via its file structure, 
if mounted on the filesystem of the host. This package also includes the "regionset" utility 
to change the region code on RPC II DVD ROM drives, and the "dvdbackup" tool to make backup 
copies of DVD ROMs as image files.



eXtended linux video
xlv.sorceforge.net

XLV is a middle-level interface for Audio/Video (and generic multimedia format) playing,
recording, and managing. The idea is that what you can do automatically (with one call) 
can also be done manually (all the decoding process can be extracted from the automate). 
XLV comes with a full bunch of plugins, including Vorbis, MPEG audio decoding, MPEG 1/2 
video decoding, a Win32 codec interface, AVI decoder, Wave decoder, Quicktime decoder, 
MPEG/VOB (DVD file) decoder, and more functionalities like auto-format conversion, etc.



CD extraction (to wav?):
cdparanoia
http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/

cdparanoia reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, 
and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw 16 bit linear PCM. Cdparanoia 
will read correct, rock-solid audio data from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, 
frame jitter and loss of streaming during atomic reads. cdparanoia will also read and repair 
data from CDs that have been damaged in some way.



CD extraction (to mp3):
makemp3.py
ftp://heron.ucsd.edu/pub/Linux/makemp3-1.3.tar.gz (tarfile)

MakeMP3.py is a Python script for ripping a CD into a set of named MP3 files. It finds 
your CD's album and track names from an online CDDB database, then coodinates both the 
ripping, naming, and encoding of the music tracks. It uses the ultra-fast gogo MP3 encoder.



kmediagrab (Video manipulation)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kmediagrab/

KMediagrab is a media grabber and encoder built on top of mplayer/mencoder. It can grab 
and encode a DVD at the same time (e.g., creating a divx or a videocd file for instance), 
record a movie or your favourite TV program from your TV-card, or translate a video file 
from one format to another (e.g., create a realplayer file from a .wmv one).
